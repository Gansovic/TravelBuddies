# TravelBuddies – MVP Product Specification (Memory Recording Focus)

## Executive Summary

TravelBuddies is a **real-time collaborative trip recording app** that automatically creates a shared travel journal as groups explore together. Unlike traditional travel apps focused on planning or expense splitting, TravelBuddies captures memories as they happen through photos, videos, voice notes, and location tracking, building a beautiful timeline that tells the story of your journey.

---

## 1. Product Vision & Goals

### 1.1 Core Problem
- Groups traveling together struggle to consolidate memories across multiple phones and cameras
- Beautiful moments get lost in camera rolls and are never properly shared
- No single source of truth for "what we did" and "where we went" on the trip
- Post-trip photo sharing is tedious and often never happens
- Travel memories lack context (where was this? when? who was there?)

### 1.2 Solution
- **One-tap moment capture** that automatically adds to a shared timeline
- **Real-time collaboration** where all trip members contribute to the same journey
- **Automatic organization** by time, location, and day with rich metadata
- **Zero planning required** - start recording immediately
- **Intelligent memory enhancement** with weather, place names, and context

### 1.3 Success Metrics
- 60% of trips have 3+ active contributors
- Average 30+ moments captured per trip day
- 75% of users view timeline during the trip
- 70% of users export/share their recap post-trip
- 50% of users create a second trip
